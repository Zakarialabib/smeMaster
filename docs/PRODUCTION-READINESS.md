## GATE 0 — STOP CONDITIONS ✅ PASS

### 0.1 Attack Surface Audit

- [x] 652 `#[tauri::command]` IPC commands across 62 files audited
- [x] No command accepts raw SQL strings — all use `sqlx::query!`/`query_as!` with parameterized bindings
- [x] No command writes to arbitrary file paths — all paths rooted at `app_data_dir()`
- [x] PGP/crypto commands sanitize all inputs (uses `spawn_blocking`, no `unwrap()` in production paths)
- [x] `db_execute_insert` is gated — wrapped in `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`
- [x] High-risk commands documented

**Full evidence:** [`../SECURITY-AUDIT.md`](../SECURITY-AUDIT.md)

### 0.2 Credential Storage

- [x] OAuth tokens encrypted via `db::crypto::encrypt_value` (AES-256-GCM)
- [x] IMAP/SMTP passwords encrypted, NOT plaintext
- [x] Encryption key derived at runtime, NOT in app bundle, NOT in git
- [x] No credentials in logs (grep verified)
- [x] Crypto module has 15 tests covering edge cases

### 0.3 Migration Safety

- [x] 56 migrations, each with `up` semantics
- [x] All use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX` — no silent data loss
- [x] Migration runner uses `RETURNING` with `sqlx::query_as`

### 0.4 Data Loss Scenarios

- [x] WAL journal mode enabled
- [x] WAL checkpoint on shutdown
- [x] Background services have graceful shutdown

---

  - Writes to `{app_data_dir}/com.smemaster.app/crash.log`
  - Outputs to stderr
- [x] All 652 commands return `CmdResult<>` or `Result<>`
- [ ] Manual test: inject a panic in a command → verify dialog appears

### 1.2 SQLite WAL Recovery

- [x] `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` set on every connection
- [x] `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` on graceful shutdown

- [x] Documentation: what happens if WAL file is deleted while running (`docs/05-DEVELOPMENT/04-wal-deletion.md`)

### 1.3 Background Service Resilience

- [x] Each background service uses `orchestrator::Service` trait with managed lifecycle
- [x] `watchdog.rs` restarts crashed services (up to 3 retries with exponential backoff)
- [ ] Manual test: panic inside `sync_engine` loop → verify watchdog restarts it
- [ ] Manual test: panic inside `queue_service` loop → verify other services unaffected

### 1.4 Frontend Error Boundaries

- [x] Top-level `ErrorBoundary` in `App.tsx` wraps entire return
- [x] Nested ErrorBoundaries for `Composer`, `CommandPalette`, `AskInbox`
- [x] Skip-to-content link + `aria-live` status announcer (Gate 5)
